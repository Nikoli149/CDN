CIS 400 Final Project

Objective: Create an exercise game that compels users to perform minimal exercise every day to reduce the risk of heart disease. The game should be motivational, and remove as many barriers as possible between the user and their necessary exercise. Emphasis will be placed on making the game enticing, and ensuring that a balance between what the user needs and what the user is willing to do is met
